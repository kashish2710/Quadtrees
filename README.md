# Quadtrees
Efficient spatial partitioning using Quadtree data structure implemented in C++. Includes insertion, search, deletion, and visualization-ready modules.
// Introduction
A Quadtree is a tree data structure used to partition a two-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into four quadrants. This repository implements Quadtree from scratch in C++, suitable for:

Image representation

Collision detection in games

Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
